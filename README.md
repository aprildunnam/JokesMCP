# Using an MCP Server with Microsoft Copilot Studio ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–

Welcome to the using an MCP Server with Microsoft Copilot Studio lab. In this lab, you will learn how to deploy an MCP Server, and how to add it to Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standardized interface developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) that enables external systems to interact with AI models by providing relevant context and receiving responses. In Microsoft Copilot Studio, you can add an MCP Server as a action. MCP Servers can consist of resources, tools and/or prompts. The tools are currently supported in Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## MCP vs Connectors

TODO: Why would you use MCP instead of connectors?

## Prerequisites

- Azure Subscription (with payment method added)
- Node installed (preferably with NVM)
- Have a GitHub account and be logged in

## Minimal Path To Awesome

To be able to deploy this MCP Server and use it in Microsoft Copilot Studio, you need to go through the following actions:

- Create a new GitHub repository based on the template
- Set up the MCP Server as an Azure Web App
- Create the Power Platform Connector
- Add the MCP Server as an action in Microsoft Copilot Studio

### Part 1: Create a new GitHub repository based on the template

1. Select `Use this template`
1. Select `Create a new repository

    ![](./assets/usetemplate.png)

1. Select the right `Owner` 
1. Give it a `Repository name`
1. Optionally you can give it a `Description`
1. Select `Public` (if you want to make the repository publicly available) or `Private` (if you want to keep it private - **RECOMMENDED**)
1. Select `Create repository`

    This will take a little while. After it's done, you will be directed to the newly created repository.

> [!WARNING]  
> After completing the steps in this lab, you will have an MCP Server running on Azure that is publicly available. Ideally, you don't want that. Make sure to delete the Azure Web App after finishing the lab.

### Part 2: Deploy the Azure Web App and configure it to grab the source from the GitHub repository

### Part 3: Create the Power Platform Connector

1. Replace the `host` in the below OpenAPI v2 spec with the host of your web API

1. Select the `Discover all` button
1. Under Data, select the `pin icon` next to `Custom connectors` to pin it to the left menu
